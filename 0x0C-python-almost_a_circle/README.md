Requirements


Python Scripts

1.Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

2.All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)

3.All your files should end with a new line

4.The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3

5.A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

6.Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)

7.All your files must be executable

8.The length of your files will be tested using wc

9.All your modules should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'

10.All your classes should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'

11.All your functions (inside and outside a class) should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'

12.A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)




Python Unit Tests


1.Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

2.All your files should end with a new line

3.All your test files should be inside a folder tests

4.You have to use the unittest module

5.All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)

6.All your test files and folders should start with test_

7.Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for models/base.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base.py

8.All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests

9.You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py

10.We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases so that you don’t miss any edge case
